DESCRIPTION OF EACH CLASS
=================================================

STUDENTWORLD
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

init()
the init function loads all the main levels and sublevels

move()
reduces the time limit
checks if the level was finished 
if not then calles doSomething for each object
if player died 
then return player died 
otherwise return corresponding game status

cleanup()
free all memory in actor container 
and player container

getCurrentSubLevel()
returns the current sublevel

CheckAt()
the checkat function checks the current sublevel for whatever is at a certain x,y coordinate and returns a stacks that holds the id's of whaterver is on the spot

checkAtForPlayer()
checks if there is a player on a certian spot

cleanTheDead()
looks through the actor container and delete all
the dead objects

scanAreaForBullies()
checks if there are bully in a 3x3 area, and checks if there are any bullies in the area and returns true or false correspondingly

getCurrentTimeLimit()
returns current time limit

fulfilledReqs()
return true if player finished level

retrieveAllGoodiesat()
returns a stack of Actor pointers of Extralife
Restorehealth, and Ammo goodies (so that the bully can take the contents and delete the one in the actor containers by setting it to dead)

retrieveAllGruntsat()
returns a stack of Actor pointers to Gangsters and bullies, a helper function for farplaneGun

finishedLevel()
sets the level to be finished

setDisplaySet()
sets the display on the top 

setCurrentSubLevel()
sets the currentsublevel

FarplaneDamage()
damages bullies and gangster in a 9x9 area

ACTORS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Actor
---------------------------------------------
Actor is my base class for all my objects and has a two pure virtual functions that it passes down
the doSomething()) function and the Interactions() function, the interactions function is a function that
dictates how each of the object will react when in contact with other Actors

Goodies
---------------------------------------------

Goodies is a child class of Actor and a base class for FarplaneGun, Restorehealth, Extralife, and Ammo
it is an abstract class, but it has an implementation of dosomething, but calls the interactions function depending on
what type of goody it is 

MortalObjects
---------------------------------------------

MortalObjects is a child class of Actor and a parent class of the the sentient class and water pool
dictates how the hit points will work

Sentient 
------------------------------------------

child class of MortalObjects and parent class of Gangster, robotboss, bullies, and player
has a movement function that dictates how the robotboss and the gangsters will move
and has a shootAtPlayer function that dictates how the gangsters, robotboss, and bullies will shoot 
the sentient interactions function have the shoot function for all my sentient classes

Statics
------------------------------------------

is a child class of Actor and a parent class for wall, fakewall, and exit
it does nothing, but is a abstract class

Wall
----------------------------------------
deos nothing

FakeWall
------------------------------------------
does nothing

Player
-----------------------------------------

the player is a derived class of sentient, and has functions that manages the ammo
the movement function detects whether the user has press corresponding keys that either shoots,
move, or decrement lives

Gold
-------------------------------------
is a derived class of Actor( I did not make this a derived class of goodies because the bully does not use it)
detects if a the player is on it and act accordingly through its Interaction with player

Gangster
-------------------------------------
gangster is a derived class of my sentient class, and uses the movement method of the sentient class, 
the doSomthing function implemented detects how many action it does per ticks and either shoots the player or moves or 
turn around. Its Interactions function dictates how it reacts to other objects, with bullets it gets damaged, with the farplanegun it gets 
killed
has 10 hp

Robotbosses
-----------------------------------
is the same as a horizontal gangster and has 50 hp instead of 10

Bully
-----------------------------------------
derived class of sentient

the bully operates and rest on certain ticks

when it acts it checks if there is a goody through foundgoodies()
when it dies it calls dropGoodies and resinserts the goodies into the actor containter
the distancebeforeturning dictates when the bully changes direction after a certain amount amount of steps
the directionrandomize chooses a random number from 1 to 4 corresponding to the four directions.
the movement function moves the bully and calls movementobstructed when bully is obstructed
movementobstructed() is called when obstructed or when it has already walked in a certain direction in 6 steps
then calls the distancerandomize to reset the the walkcounter
the bully's Interaction function checks if there are goodies around to be picked up, and gets killed if within the farplaneDamage vicinity

Bullet
----------------------------------------

checks the objects in its current location and checks if there is a sentient object, and damages the sentient
by calling its interactions function 
gets destroyed if encounters a wall, waterpool
otherwise moves the bullet in its directions 
and checks the objects in its current location again
I chose this class to not be part of sentient even though it moves because it does not have hit points
and its movement algorithm is different and much more simpler

Extralife, RestoreHealth, Ammo
----------------------------------------

these are child classes of goodies, and its interaction specify what it does specifically if there 
is a player or bully on it

Hostage
---------------------------------------
the hostage is a child class of a goody but does not interact with the bully and only the player

FarplaneGun
----------------------------------
FarplaneGun is a a child class of the goodies, and calles the studentworld function FarplaneDamage and damages all bullies and gangsters in a 9x9 radius and 
hacks off 10 hit points from the player

Gate
----------------------------------

the gate class is a derived class of Actor,
my implementation of how the player moves between level is to have a player container to move the player between each level accordingly
so in its doSomething implementation I have it call the studentWorld function setCurrentSubLevel, which sets the current sub level to the sub level indicated by the gate number

Exit
--------------------------------------
Exit is a derived class of statics
the Exit doSomething checks if the player has fulfilled all the requirements for the Exit to appear and when it does appear, it checks
if the player is on it and tells the studentworld that the level is finished

Waterpool
-----------------------------------
the waterpool is a mortalobject because it has 30 hit points and dies after 30 ticks
the dosomething decrements its hitpoints every turn until it hits zero and dies

Bullynest
----------------------------------

the bully nest is a derived class of Actor
its dosomething calls the studentworld function scanareaforbullies to check if there are 3 or less bullies in the 3x3 surrounding area, if that
is true it calls the chancetocreatebully function which has a 1/50 chance of return true, and if it is true, it creates a new bully at the coordinate
of the bullynest

2)

i FINISHED all the classes i was required to do, and there are currently no known bugs i was unable to finished

3)

For my gate implementation , I ASKED THE PROFESSOR AND THE TA'S IF I COULD HAVE A SEPARATE CONTAINER FOR PLAYERS AND THEY SAID YES, so i had a containers
of players in each sublevel so i can teleport the player between each sublevel correspondingly, also the spec did not specify whenther the fakewall animation should be atop the bullies, gangsters, players, or robotbosses' animation so, i did not concern myself with that

4) 

TESTING
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++==

Actor
---------------------------------------------
i tested whether it was an abstract class or not by using new

Goodies
---------------------------------------------
i tested whether it was an abstract class or not by using new

MortalObjects
---------------------------------------------
i tested whether it was an abstract class or not by using new


Sentient 
------------------------------------------
i tested whether it was an abstract class or not by using new


Statics
------------------------------------------
i tested whether it was an abstract class or not by using new


Wall
----------------------------------------
the wall does nothing, therefore i did not test it, the other classes dictates how it should react to a wall

FakeWall
------------------------------------------
the fakewall does nothing, therefore i did not test it, the other classes dictates how it should react to a fakewall

Player
-----------------------------------------
I tested how the movement corresponded with user input and whether the shoot function works as intended,
I also tested whether it could walk through walls or other obstructed objects which obstructs player movements
I tested whether the hitpoints decrement accordingly to damage.

Gold
-------------------------------------
I tested if it gives the right amount of points and goes away when picked up

Gangster
-------------------------------------
I check if its movement algorithm does as intended and whether the shootAtPlayer algorith shoots the player only if there is no obstruction
and if the player is behing at least one fake wall
I check if acts on certain amount of ticks passed

Bully
-----------------------------------------

I check if its movement algorithm works as intended by comparing it with the example roboblast game for fifteen minutes and it was similar
I check if its shootatPlayer works, and i checked if acts only certain amount of ticks
i tested its picking up goodies algorithm to check if only picks up the correct goodies and resinsert the goodies into the container when it dies
into the actor container

Bullet
----------------------------------------
The bullet was checked intensively
I checked if it sees a sentient in its location and damages accordingly to the sentient
I checked if it could pass through certain objects or gets destroyed when it hits certain objects
I check if the bullet moves in the right direction


Extralife, RestoreHealth, Ammo
----------------------------------------
I tested if it gives the right amount of points and goes away when picked up
I tested if it works accordingly with the bully when it is picked up

Hostage
---------------------------------------
I tested if it gives the right amount of points and goes away when picked up

FarplaneGun
----------------------------------
I tested if it damages bullies and gangster in a 9x9 radius and decrements the players hit points by 10

Gate
----------------------------------
I checked if the gate teleport the player to the correct position in the sublevel and when it teleports back to the main level
it teleports the player back to its previous location in the main level


Exit
--------------------------------------
checks if it works and return the finished game level indication

Waterpool
-----------------------------------
checks if it lives for only 30 ticks and interacts with other objects as an obstruction appropriately

Bullynest
----------------------------------
Checks if it spawns bully at a reasonable rate and checks whether it spawns bullies only when there are 3 or less bullies in
a 3x3 area from the bully nest
